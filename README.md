Objectives

In this this PyCitySchools scenario, lets assume that I am the Chief Data Scientist for my city’s school district, comprised of 15 schools of both charter and districts. I am tasked with helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.  I have been provided with access to every student’s math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase the following trends in school performance:

o	District Summary
o	School Summary
o	Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
o	Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
o	Math Scores by Grade
o	Reading Scores by Grade
o	Scores by School Spending
o	Scores by School Size
o	Scores by School Type

Observations Based Upon Findings

1.	When comparing Top Performing Schools versus Bottom Performing schools (By % Overall Passing), Charter Schools outperform District schools by approximately 40% in math and reading. 

2.	Furthermore, the charter schools spend less dollars per student while maintaining a higher overall passing scores as noted above.  When comparing the average of the  per-student budget between top versus bottom performance, the top performers (all charter schools), spend approximately $40 less per student. 

3.	Average reading scores were higher than math scores in the District Summary.  Speculating whether or not students score higher as they progress through High School, I performed further calculations to determine each level of High School (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade). The combined schools’ average math score was 80% and the average reading score for each grade was 82%.  These figures correlate to the District Summary table as well.
